## 1. Workspace Preparation

Before starting the formulation, ensure that your workspace and equipment are properly sanitized. Wipe all surfaces and utensils with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Wash beakers, jars, and stirring tools with hot water and mild detergent, then rinse with distilled water. Dry completely using clean towels or air drying. Wear gloves, a hairnet, and if possible, a lab coat to maintain hygiene and prevent contamination.

The basic equipment required includes two heat-resistant glass beakers, a digital scale capable of measuring to 0.01 grams, a thermometer that can read temperatures up to 100°C, a magnetic stirrer or manual whisk, a water bath or double boiler for heating, a spatula or glass rod for stirring, and clean jars or pump bottles for packaging.

## 2. Formula for 100 g of Cream

The formulation consists of three phases: an oil phase, a water phase, and a cool-down phase.

For the oil phase, you will need 10 grams of sweet almond oil as an emollient, 5 grams of shea butter to provide deep moisturization, 4 grams of emulsifying wax to help bind the oil and water together, and 2 grams of cetyl alcohol to thicken and stabilize the emulsion.

For the water phase, use 68 grams of distilled water as the main solvent, 3 grams of glycerin as a humectant to draw moisture into the skin, and 1 gram of panthenol (vitamin B5) to soothe and hydrate.

Finally, in the cool-down phase, include 1 gram of preservative such as phenoxyethanol or Optiphen to prevent microbial growth, 0.5 grams of vitamin E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from oxidation, and 0.5 grams of essential oil (optional) for fragrance or additional skin benefits.

The total formula yields 100 grams of cream.
