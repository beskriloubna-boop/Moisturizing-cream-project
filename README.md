#  Natural Hydration Cream Project

###  Description
A simple experiment to make a natural moisturizing cream using safe, natural ingredients.  
This project shows how emulsification helps mix oil and water to form a smooth, hydrating cream.

---

### Objective
To understand how oil and water can be combined into a stable emulsion using an emulsifier.

---

###  Ingredients
- Distilled water (60 ml)  
- Aloe vera gel (10 ml)  
- Sweet almond oil (20 ml)  
- Shea butter (10 g)  
- Emulsifying wax (5 g)  
- Vitamin E oil (3 drops)  
- Essential oil (optional)  
- Preservative (optional)

###  Equipment
- 2 heat-resistant glass bowls  
- 1 pot (for double boiler)  
- Measuring spoons or scale  
- Whisk or spoon  
- Clean jar

## 2. Formula for 100 g of Cream

The formulation consists of three phases: an oil phase, a water phase, and a cool-down phase.

For the oil phase, you will need 10 grams of sweet almond oil as an emollient, 5 grams of shea butter to provide deep moisturization, 4 grams of emulsifying wax to help bind the oil and water together, and 2 grams of cetyl alcohol to thicken and stabilize the emulsion.

For the water phase, use 68 grams of distilled water as the main solvent, 3 grams of glycerin as a humectant to draw moisture into the skin, and 1 gram of panthenol (vitamin B5) to soothe and hydrate.

Finally, in the cool-down phase, include 1 gram of preservative such as phenoxyethanol or Optiphen to prevent microbial growth, 0.5 grams of vitamin E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from oxidation, and 0.5 grams of essential oil (optional) for fragrance or additional skin benefits.

The total formula yields 100 grams of cream.

## 3. Heating and Mixing Procedure

Start by preparing the oil phase. In the first beaker, combine almond oil, shea butter, emulsifying wax, and cetyl alcohol. Heat this mixture gently in a water bath until all solid components are fully melted, maintaining a temperature between 70°C and 75°C. Stir occasionally to ensure uniform heating.

Next, prepare the water phase in the second beaker. Mix the distilled water, glycerin, and panthenol, and heat to the same temperature range (70°C to 75°C) so both phases are thermally balanced.

Once both phases reach equal temperature, slowly pour the water phase into the oil phase while stirring continuously. Use a whisk or magnetic stirrer to maintain even mixing. Continue stirring for three to five minutes until the mixture begins to thicken and a smooth, uniform emulsion forms. Maintaining the temperature during this process helps create a stable and consistent texture.

## 4. Cooling and Final Additions

Allow the emulsion to cool naturally to below 40°C. This is important because adding preservatives or essential oils at higher temperatures may cause them to degrade or lose effectiveness. Once the mixture reaches 40°C or lower, add the preservative, vitamin E, and essential oil. Stir gently until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.

If possible, check the pH of the final cream using pH strips or a meter. The ideal pH for skin application is between 5.0 and 6.0. If the pH is below 5.0, adjust slightly with a few drops of a diluted sodium hydroxide solution (0.1%). If it is above 6.0, adjust by adding a small amount of a diluted citric acid solution (0.1%).
