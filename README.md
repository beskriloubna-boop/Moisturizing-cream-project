## 2. Formula for 100 g of Cream

The formulation consists of three phases: an oil phase, a water phase, and a cool-down phase.

For the oil phase, you will need 10 grams of sweet almond oil as an emollient, 5 grams of shea butter to provide deep moisturization, 4 grams of emulsifying wax to help bind the oil and water together, and 2 grams of cetyl alcohol to thicken and stabilize the emulsion.

For the water phase, use 68 grams of distilled water as the main solvent, 3 grams of glycerin as a humectant to draw moisture into the skin, and 1 gram of panthenol (vitamin B5) to soothe and hydrate.

Finally, in the cool-down phase, include 1 gram of preservative such as phenoxyethanol or Optiphen to prevent microbial growth, 0.5 grams of vitamin E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from oxidation, and 0.5 grams of essential oil (optional) for fragrance or additional skin benefits.

The total formula yields 100 grams of cream.
