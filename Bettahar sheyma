#  Natural Hydration Cream Project

###  Description
A simple experiment to make a natural moisturizing cream using safe, natural ingredients.  
This project shows how emulsification helps mix oil and water to form a smooth, hydrating cream.

---

### Objective
To understand how oil and water can be combined into a stable emulsion using an emulsifier.

---

###  Ingredients
- Distilled water (60 ml)  
- Aloe vera gel (10 ml)  
- Sweet almond oil (20 ml)  
- Shea butter (10 g)  
- Emulsifying wax (5 g)  
- Vitamin E oil (3 drops)  
- Essential oil (optional)  
- Preservative (optional)

###  Equipment
- 2 heat-resistant glass bowls  
- 1 pot (for double boiler)  
- Measuring spoons or scale  
- Whisk or spoon  
- Clean jar

## 2. Formula for 100 g of Cream

The formulation consists of three phases: an oil phase, a water phase, and a cool-down phase.

For the oil phase, you will need 10 grams of sweet almond oil as an emollient, 5 grams of shea butter to provide deep moisturization, 4 grams of emulsifying wax to help bind the oil and water together, and 2 grams of cetyl alcohol to thicken and stabilize the emulsion.

For the water phase, use 68 grams of distilled water as the main solvent, 3 grams of glycerin as a humectant to draw moisture into the skin, and 1 gram of panthenol (vitamin B5) to soothe and hydrate.

Finally, in the cool-down phase, include 1 gram of preservative such as phenoxyethanol or Optiphen to prevent microbial growth, 0.5 grams of vitamin E as an antioxidant to protect the oils from oxidation, and 0.5 grams of essential oil (optional) for fragrance or additional skin benefits.

The total formula yields 100 grams of cream.

## 3. Heating and Mixing Procedure

Start by preparing the oil phase. In the first beaker, combine almond oil, shea butter, emulsifying wax, and cetyl alcohol. Heat this mixture gently in a water bath until all solid components are fully melted, maintaining a temperature between 70°C and 75°C. Stir occasionally to ensure uniform heating.

Next, prepare the water phase in the second beaker. Mix the distilled water, glycerin, and panthenol, and heat to the same temperature range (70°C to 75°C) so both phases are thermally balanced.

Once both phases reach equal temperature, slowly pour the water phase into the oil phase while stirring continuously. Use a whisk or magnetic stirrer to maintain even mixing. Continue stirring for three to five minutes until the mixture begins to thicken and a smooth, uniform emulsion forms. Maintaining the temperature during this process helps create a stable and consistent texture.

## 4. Cooling and Final Additions

Allow the emulsion to cool naturally to below 40°C. This is important because adding preservatives or essential oils at higher temperatures may cause them to degrade or lose effectiveness. Once the mixture reaches 40°C or lower, add the preservative, vitamin E, and essential oil. Stir gently until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.

If possible, check the pH of the final cream using pH strips or a meter. The ideal pH for skin application is between 5.0 and 6.0. If the pH is below 5.0, adjust slightly with a few drops of a diluted sodium hydroxide solution (0.1%). If it is above 6.0, adjust by adding a small amount of a diluted citric acid solution (0.1%).

## 5. Packaging and Labeling

Once the cream has cooled completely and reached a uniform consistency, pour it into sterilized jars or airless pump bottles. Seal the containers tightly to prevent air exposure and contamination. Label each container with the product name, batch number, manufacturing date, and expiration date. For home or educational formulations, a three- to six-month shelf life is recommended if stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

## 6. Safety and Testing

Always perform a patch test before full use. Apply a small amount of the finished product to the inside of your forearm and observe for 24 hours to check for irritation or allergic reactions. Discontinue use if redness or discomfort occurs. Keep all tools and surfaces sterile during preparation. Discard any cream that develops an unusual odor, color change, or separation.

Avoid using metal utensils when working with essential oils, as they can sometimes react with metal surfaces. If natural extracts such as aloe vera or cucumber are added, store the finished product in a refrigerator and use it within three months.
  ## 7. Optional Variations

To adapt the base formula for different skin types, modify the ingredients as follows.

For oily skin, replace shea butter with jojoba oil to create a lighter, less greasy cream.  
For dry skin, increase the richness by adding 2% cocoa butter or 0.5% hyaluronic acid.  
For a soothing or calming cream, include 0.5% chamomile extract to reduce irritation and redness.  
For a night cream, increase the oil phase by about three percent to achieve a thicker, more nourishing texture.
